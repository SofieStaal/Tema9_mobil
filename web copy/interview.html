        <p> The director of information security for the newsroom is making journalists more secure against a world of increasing digital threats.

                There is a gap in newsrooms. On one side, journalists and editors go about their work, writing and publishing stories. On the other, a security team protects the company's networks and infrastructure.</p>

            <p>But today, there are more digital threats against journalists, their sources, and their employers than ever before. So the two sides need to meet in the middle in order to maintain the safety of all involved.
            </p>
            <p>"I end up being a bridge," Sandvik, who has the unique title of 'Director of Information Security for the Newsroom,' told Motherboard in a phone call.</p>
            <p class="sitat">I got it infected pretty frequently.</p>
            <p>Although Sandvik has been training journalists for years, this position at the <i>Times</i> was a whole new creation; she sits with reporters in the newsroom itself, able to assist with security issues.</p>
            <p>"It's not a pure security role; it's not a pure support role, it's a jack-of-all trades type of role, because you end up wearing a whole load of hats," she said.</p>
            <p>Indeed, Sandvik's own history has jumped between journalism, security, and development. As a child growing up in Norway she wanted to be a lawyer, but got her first computer when she was 15 years old.</p>
            <p>"Things changed from there," Sandvik said. She would download anything and everything, opening files to see what would happen.</p>
            <p>"I got it infected pretty frequently," she added. In 2009, she contributed to the Tor Project, the nonprofit behind the Tor anonymity network, before working for a penetration testing and code audit company, and joining the Tor Project full time.</p>

                Meow meow burrow under covers, and scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food for attack feet. I could pee on this if i had the energy spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum so i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun knock over christmas tree. Pounce on unsuspecting person.</p>

            <p>Burrow under covers eat the fat cats food, eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap, friends are not food for pounce on unsuspecting person or plop down in the middle where everybody walks or i'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow. Pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space kitty power kitty power purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr.
